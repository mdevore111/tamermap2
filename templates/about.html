<div class="about-section">
    <div class="story-section">
        <h2>Our Journey Begins</h2>
        <p>TamerMap was born from a simple yet powerful realization: finding Pokémon cards shouldn't be a quest worthy of a legendary Pokémon. As collectors and enthusiasts ourselves, we understood the frustration of driving from store to store, hoping to find that perfect pack or elusive single card. We knew there had to be a better way.</p>
        
        <p>What started as a personal project to map local card shops quickly evolved into something much bigger. We discovered that thousands of trainers across the nation shared our challenge. From dedicated Pokémon Center kiosks to local game stores, from major retailers to indie shops running special events - the Pokémon card ecosystem was vast but disconnected. That's when TamerMap's true mission became clear: to create the ultimate interactive map that brings the entire Pokémon card hunting experience together.</p>
