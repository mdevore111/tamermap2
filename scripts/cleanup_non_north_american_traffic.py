Cleanup Non-North American Traffic Script

This script removes visitor log entries from countries outside North America.
It targets traffic that should have been blocked by Cloudflare geo-fencing rules
but may have gotten through due to:
- Bot traffic spoofing user agents
- Direct server access bypassing Cloudflare
- Rule configuration issues

North American countries included:
- US (United States)
- CA (Canada) 
- MX (Mexico)

SAFETY FEATURES:
- Shows what will be deleted before proceeding
- Creates backup of affected data
- Only affects non-North American traffic
- Preserves all legitimate North American traffic
- Dry-run mode to preview changes
