Cleanup Historical Monitoring Traffic Script

This script removes historical traffic data from monitoring IPs (10.x.x.x network and staging server)
that was collected before the traffic filtering was implemented.

SAFETY FEATURES:
- Shows what will be deleted before proceeding
- Creates backup of affected data
- Only affects monitoring IPs (10.x.x.x)
- Preserves all legitimate user traffic
